    "## Circuit Noise Simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "To benchmark our measurement protocol, it is essential to simulate noisy quantum circuits using tensor-network methods. Such simulations can be performed either via density-matrix techniques or by employing quantum trajectory methods. For further details on these simulation approaches, see [Daniel Jaschke et al., 2019, Quantum Sci. Technol. 4, 013001](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aae724).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we illustrate several basic routines for simulating noisy random circuits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Noise Model:**  \n",
    "  We implement a local depolarization channel as our noise model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation Methods:**  \n",
    "  1. **Density Matrix MPO Simulation:**  \n",
    "     This method uses Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) to simulate the full density matrix of the system. While this approach accurately captures mixed-state dynamics, it requires roughly double the memory since the Hilbert space is effectively squared.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. **Quantum Trajectory (Pure State Sampling) Simulation:**  \n",
    "     Here, the evolution is simulated via pure states only (using techniques similar to quantum trajectories). This method is more memory efficient but requires averaging over many sampled trajectories to reproduce the mixed-state behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "These simulation methods provide complementary insights into the effects of noise on quantum circuits and help us benchmark the performance of randomized measurement protocols."
